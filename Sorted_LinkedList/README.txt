Project Description:
	
	The project's goal is to create a linkedlist that will take a person's first name and put the 
 first name into the linked list. This linked list class will make an initial for the name before the 
 first name alphabet in the list. For example if we have 2 names that start with letter A{Amy, Anny}
 then the list will look like this: {A : Amy : Anny}. The initial of the first letter of the name will
 preceed all of the names. All of the names will be sorted. 
	
	The remove method of this class will remove the name if the user specify any spcific name that is
 in the list. Or if any specific letter that the user want to remove, all of the names that started with 
 that letter will be remove. And last case is if the name that was remove is the last name in the list
 started with certain letter, then that letter will also then be remove. 
	
	The find method will find the name that matched with the name in the list. 

	Print method will print the entire list.
